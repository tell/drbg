# Deterministic Random Bytes Generation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tell/drbg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tell/drbg)

This is an implementation of deterministic random bytes generation (a.k.a. pseudo random funcation family) using [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium).

# Note

This is an experimental implementation, be careful when you use. Validity of this implementation is not checked so much.
